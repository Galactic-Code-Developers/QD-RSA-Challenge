# 🔓 Open Challenge: Break QD-RSA v1.1

**Welcome to the official QD-RSA cryptanalysis challenge.**
This pinned issue invites cryptographers, security researchers, and quantum computing experts to rigorously analyze and test the QD-RSA v1.1 system.

## 📌 Objective

We challenge the community to find any cryptographic weakness, inversion strategy, or implementation flaw in **any of the following layers**:

### 🧩 1. Masking Function:
Φₛ(x) = x · sin((π + εₛ) · x) mod n
- Can it be approximated or reversed without knowing εₛ?
- Are FFT or lattice-based inversion strategies effective?

### 🧬 2. Trap Function:
Ξₛ(x) = (x + r)² · cosh(γ(x + r)) · tan⁻¹(δ(x + r)) mod n
- Can symbolic regression, surrogate modeling, or QML defeat this layer?

### 🔐 3. Symbolic Hash:
𝓘ₛ*(x) = SHA3-256 ( ∑ xᵏ / bᵏ for k = 1 to Nₛ )
- Can Grover-enhanced attacks recover x or forge a preimage?
- Is symbolic structure leaking through the hash?
