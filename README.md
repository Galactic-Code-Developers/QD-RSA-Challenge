This repository contains the public specification, challenge brief, and reference implementation for QD-RSA v1.2—a quantum-resilient RSA enhancement.

## Overview
QD-RSA introduces three entropy-hardened symbolic transformations:
- Φₛ(x): Session-specific sine-masked domain encoding
- Ξₛ(x): Entropy-shifted non-convex trap function
- 𝓘ₛ*(x): SHA3-wrapped symbolic hash

# 🔓 Open Challenge: Break QD-RSA v1.2

**Welcome to the official QD-RSA cryptanalysis challenge.**
This pinned issue invites cryptographers, security researchers, and quantum computing experts to rigorously analyze and test the QD-RSA v1.1 system.

## 📌 Objective

We challenge the community to find any cryptographic weakness, inversion strategy, or implementation flaw in **any of the following layers**:

### 🧩 1. Masking Function:
Φₛ(x) = x · sin((π + εₛ) · x) mod n
- Can it be approximated or reversed without knowing εₛ?
- Are FFT or lattice-based inversion strategies effective?

### 🧬 2. Trap Function:
Ξₛ(x) = (x + r)² · cosh(γ(x + r)) · tan⁻¹(δ(x + r)) mod n
- Can symbolic regression, surrogate modeling, or QML defeat this layer?

### 🔐 3. Symbolic Hash:
𝓘ₛ*(x) = SHA3-256 ( ∑ xᵏ / bᵏ for k = 1 to Nₛ )
- Can Grover-enhanced attacks recover x or forge a preimage?
- Is symbolic structure leaking through the hash?

## 🔐 FAQ: Does QD-RSA contain any government-access mechanism or DoD backdoor?

**No.** QD-RSA does not contain any mechanism that would allow the Department of Defense (DoD), any governmental body, or any privileged party to reverse, bypass, or decrypt communications without possession of the correct private key and session-specific entropy parameters.

Specifically:

- QD-RSA includes **no master key**, **no escrow system**, **no decryption oracle**, and **no entropy bias**.
- All entropy values (`εₛ`, `r`) are derived per session and are non-recoverable without explicit knowledge.
- The system is built according to open cryptographic principles and does not include any privileged override mechanism.

**Design Philosophy:** QD-RSA is engineered for public, trustless, and post-quantum-resilient encryption. It is meant to secure communications globally without centralized control or built-in surveillance vectors.

*Note:* National security protocols that require access to encrypted content should implement key management policies externally (e.g., through operational key escrow or secure key distribution), not by altering the QD-RSA algorithm itself.
