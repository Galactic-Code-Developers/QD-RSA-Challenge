## 📌 Target Layer (select one or more)
- [ ] Φₛ(x): Session-specific irrational masking
- [ ] Ξₛ(x): Entropy-shifted non-convex trap function
- [ ] 𝓘ₛ*(x): Symbolic hash wrapped in SHA3-256
- [ ] Combined pipeline weakness

## 📋 Description of the Attempt
Please describe the attack, strategy, or approximation technique used. Include whether it's theoretical or implemented, and what assumptions you made (e.g., access to ciphertext, timing side channels, etc.).

## 🧪 Reproducibility
If applicable, please provide:
- Sample input/output
- Simulation results
- Code snippets (inline or via Gist)
- Environment details (Python version, libraries, quantum simulator if used)

## 📊 Complexity or Performance Estimate
Estimate how scalable or practical your method is. For example:
- Runtime complexity (e.g., polynomial, exponential)
- Memory usage
- Experimental benchmarks

## 🔐 Notes
Any limitations, observations, or side effects of your method? Was it partial, failed, or successful under narrow conditions?
